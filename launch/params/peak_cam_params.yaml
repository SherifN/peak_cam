# In this parameter file you can change acquisition settings of the camera. 
# Before that, you should try to open the camera with the ids_visioncockpit for an approximate setting

# To add more parameters to your camera please view the IDS Vision Reference at 
# https://de.ids-imaging.com/manuals-ids-peak.html 
# and modify acquisition_parameters.hpp and setDeviceParameters() function in peak_cam class

camera_topic: image_raw

# choose which device to enter by entering its serial number here
# if you dont know it, run this node once and all serial nodes should be printed out
selectedDevice: "0000000000"

# configure your desired image size
# needs to be divisble by 8 and smaller than your imager size (Max Width, Max Height)
ImageHeight: 320
ImageWidth: 1088

# Pixelformat
# In IDS Implemented: ["Mono8", "Mono10", "Mono12", "Mono10p", "Mono12p", "BayerRG8", "BayerRG10", "BayerRG12", "BayerRG10p", "BayerRG12p", "RGB8", "RGB10p32", "BGR8", "BGR10p32"]
# Possible: ["Mono8", "RGB8", "BGR8"] as string! 
PixelFormat: "RGB8"

# DeviceLinkThroughputLimit
# limits the maximum bandwidth of data sent from a GigE camera and thus helps to avoid interference
# WATCH OUT when DeviceLinkThroughputLimit is too low there might be some latency and buffer overflows
DeviceLinkThroughputLimit: 125000000

# ExposureTime in μs
# limits the Acquisition Framerate
# When ExposureAuto is set to "Once" or "Continuous" the value won't be used
ExposureTime: 5000

# Signal source for Line1 (flash output)
# Possible: ["Off", "ExposureActive", ...]
Line1Source: "ExposureActive"

# Trigger Source used to start exposure
# Autmatically sets TriggerSelector to "ExposureStart" and TriggerMode to "On"
# Possible: ["Off", "Line0", ...]
TriggerSource: "Off"

# Trigger activation mode
# When TriggerSource is set to "Off" the value won't be used
# Possible: ["RisingEdge", "FallingEdge", "AnyEdge", "LevelHigh", "LevelLow"]
TriggerActivation: "RisingEdge"

# Trigger divider
# Only every x-th source signal will activate the trigger
# Range [0, ..., 64]
TriggerDivider: 1

# AcquisitionFrameRate in Hz
# WATCH OUT when AcquisitionFrameRate is too high there might be some latency. Check "rostopic hz /cameratopic"
AcquisitionFrameRate: 1

# Gamma
# Range [0.3, ..., 3.0]
# If no Gamma correction ist needed set to 1.0
Gamma: 1.0

# ExposureAuto Setting 
# If ExposureAuto On set ExposureTime to any value ExposureTime [sek] < 1 / AcquisitionFrameRate [sek]
# Possible: ["Off", "Once", "Continuous"] as string! 
ExposureAuto: "Continuous"

# GainAuto Setting 
# Possible: ["Off", "Once", "Continuous"] as string! 
GainAuto: "Continuous"

# GainSelector Setting 
# Possible: ["AnalogAllSource", "AnalogAll", "AnalogRed", "AnalogGreen", "AnalogBlue", "DigitalAll", "DigitalRed", "DigitalGreen", "DigitalBlue"] as string! 
GainSelector: "DigitalAll"

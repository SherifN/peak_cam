# In this parameter file you can change acquisition settings of the camera. 
# Before that, you should try to open the camera with the ids_visioncockpit for an approximate setting

# To add more parameters to your camera please view the IDS Vision Reference at 
# https://de.ids-imaging.com/manuals-ids-peak.html 
# and modify acquisition_parameters.hpp and setDeviceParameters() function in peak_cam class
